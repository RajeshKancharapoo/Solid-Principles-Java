SOLID PRINCIPLES

S - Single Responsibility

O - Open Closed

L - Liskov Substitution

I - Interface Segregation

D - Dependency Inversion

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or task to fulfill.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing new functionality to be added without altering existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Every subclass or dervied class should be substitutable for their base class or parent class

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Interfaces should not force the classes to implement the methods which they cannot use. Large interface should be divided into small ones.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
